This is TAO version 2.2a_p25, released Fri Sep  9 15:54:35 UTC 2022.

This is a modified version of the TAO originally released by the
DOC group.  It contains additional fixes and optimizations.
An overview of OCI's version of ACE and TAO is available in the
ACE_wrappers/OCIReleaseNotes.html file.  Changes made for this
patch can be found in the ACE_wrappers/TAO/OCIChangeLog file.
Many of the the changes have been included in the current versions
of TAO released by the DOC group.

Since TAO is open source and free of licensing fees, we do not
derive any revenue other than through our services and support
(and a little from book and CD sales).  So, unfortunately, we are
unable to provide free support.

For more details, and information on opening a support contract
please see http://www.theaceorb.com/support/index.html or contact

Thank you for your interest in ACE+TAO.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you do not have a support contract with OCI, "best effort" support is
available from other ACE and TAO users in the ACE/TAO mailing lists,
which are described at http://www.dre.vanderbilt.edu/~schmidt/ACE-mail.html.
Please note, however, that this support is community based, i.e.,
users help each other, so long and involved issues are less likely to
be answered.  The main objectives of these mailing lists are to
resolve issues with the latest beta versions of ACE and TAO, and to
share experiences with CORBA and ACE libraries in general.  Thus,
questions relating to earlier versions of ACE and TAO will not be
answered by the open-source development team.

An easy way to track and search for bug fixes or answers to general
questions is to go to the "comp.soft-sys.ace" newsgroup (conveniently
accessible via Google)
at http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=comp.soft-sys.ace
Another news group, "comp.object.corba", is more generalized
regarding the use of CORBA and is located at
http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&group=comp.object.corba.
