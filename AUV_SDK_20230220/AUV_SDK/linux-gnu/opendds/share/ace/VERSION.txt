This is ACE version 6.2a_p25, released Fri Sep  9 15:54:35 UTC 2022.

This is a modified version of the ACE originally released by the
DOC group.  It contains additional fixes and optimizations.
An overview of OCI's version of ACE is available in the
ACE_wrappers/OCIReleaseNotes.html file.  Changes made for this
patch can be found in the ACE_wrappers/OCIChangeLog file.
Many of the the changes have been included in the current versions
of ACE released by the DOC group.

Since ACE is open source and free of licensing fees, we do not
derive any revenue other than through our services and support
(and a little from book and CD sales).  So, unfortunately, we are
unable to provide free support.

please see http://www.theaceorb.com/support/index.html or contact
